So it's not something that you can do something, repair it and it will disappear. It will not. It is in every single corner, every single step of the way you have corruption. So how to do that? We have been ― while I'm here, I've been discussing with the representatives from many countries who have experience on addressing the corruption issues. They have specialized in designing procedures to stop corruption. So we're consulting and inviting them to help us to root out corruption forever, so that it doesn't come back again. It's not a temporary solution. It should be a permanent solution, but this is our number one priority. We want to do that. Otherwise, no matter what you do, will be completely meaningless, because corruption can twist everything around the corruption has the power to make changes without the verdict of the people</p>
